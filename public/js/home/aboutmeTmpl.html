		I am a residential real estate agent with Keller Williams South Valley. I come from a real estate family<a href="http://www.wcanmiller.com/"> (WC & AN Miller)</a> who built up much of the Washington DC area, where I was born and raised. 4 ago years my husband and I took a big leap of faith and quit our stable jobs and drove from Washington DC to Utah with no home and no jobs. It was the best decision I has ever made. Despite not having deep roots in Utah, I has found great success as a real estate agent. I attributes this to my consistent follow up, always asking for referrals, and treating my business as a business. In addition, I believes honesty, transparency, and responsiveness are keys to my success. I care deeply for the people I work with and look out for their best interest first and I believes that when your customers truly feel you care and are on their side, it will come back to you 10 fold. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and loves using her networking and connections to help others grow their businesses and careers.

		Another way I add value for my clients is my background as a <a href="http://www.emilyhayesphotography.com/Blog/">professional photoagrapher</a>. In today's world of online shopping and viewing it is now more important than ever not only to have a beautiful home but beautiful images as well.
